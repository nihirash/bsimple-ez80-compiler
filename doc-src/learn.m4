BSimple is the compiled language for eZ80 CPU(mostly for Agon computers) that can be executed on Agon Light/Console8 or your PC/Mac.

BSimple is mid-level programming language and compiles to assembly. All identifiers are case-sensitive - so `ID`, `Id` and `iD` are different identifiers.

```perl
sinclude({{examples/learn.bs}})
```

You can find this program in `examples` directory of compiler repository.
