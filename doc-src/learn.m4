changequote(`{{', `}}')# Learn BSimple in Y minutes

BSimple is the compiled language for eZ80 CPU(mostly for Agon computers) that can be executed on Agon Light/Console8 or your PC/Mac.

BSimple is mid-level programming language and compiles to assembly. All identifiers are case-sensitive - so `ID`, `Id` and `iD` are different identifiers.

All numbers are 24 bit long(and treated as signed numbers usually). 

Values placed in range âˆ’8,388,608 to 8,388,607(in decimal).

You can use also heximal values as long as decial prefix for hex values is `$`(for example `a = $7ffd;` is just the same as `a = 32765`).

```perl
sinclude({{examples/learn.bs}})
```

You can find this program in `examples` directory of compiler repository.
